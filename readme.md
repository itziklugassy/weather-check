# Weather Checker Program

## Overview

The Weather Checker is a simple interactive web application designed to help users decide whether it's a good day to go outside based on the weather conditions in their city. The application asks users to input the name of their city, whether it is sunny, and the current temperature in Celsius. Based on this input, it provides recommendations.

## Features

- **City Input**: Users can enter the name of the city they are in.
- **Sunshine Check**: Users specify if there is current sunshine.
- **Temperature Input**: Users enter the current temperature in Celsius.
- **Weather Advice**: Based on the input, the application advises whether to go outside or stay indoors.

## How It Works

The program operates as follows:

1. **City and Weather Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter their city's name.
   - The user is asked if there is sun outside ("yes" or "no").
   - The user must input the current temperature in Celsius.

2. **Logic**:
   - **Ideal Conditions**: If the temperature is between 20째C and 30째C (inclusive) and it is sunny, the application will suggest that it's a great day to go out.
   - **Stay Indoors**: If it is not sunny and the temperature is below 20째C, it recommends staying indoors.
   - **Average Conditions**: If it is not sunny and the temperature is above 30째C, it remarks that the weather conditions are average.

3. **Output**:
   - Based on the user's input, a console log message is displayed, giving an appropriate suggestion for outdoor activities.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply load the provided HTML file in any modern web browser to use the application.

## Usage

Open the HTML file in your browser, and respond to the prompts as they appear. After entering all the required information, the console (accessible via browser developer tools) will display the result.

## Technology

- **HTML5**: For structuring the interactive prompts.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic and user interactions.

## Limitations

- The program currently does not handle unexpected input types (e.g., non-numeric temperature).
- Recommendations are basic and do not consider more nuanced weather conditions like humidity or wind.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve user interface with an actual form and results displayed on the webpage instead of the console.
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
- Consider more complex weather conditions for more accurate advice.
- Integrate real-time weather data from an API.

This README provides all necessary instructions and descriptions for users and developers interested in understanding or contributing to the Weather Checker program.
